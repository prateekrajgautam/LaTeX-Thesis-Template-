The present doctoral thesis would not be possible without the support, encouragement, and contributions of so many remarkable individuals.
\par First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor \textbf{Dr. Arvind Kumar} \emph{(Associate Professor, ECED, MNNIT Allahabad)}. Without his guidance and dedicated involvement in every step throughout the process, this thesis would have never been accomplished. It's an honor and blessing to work under his supervision. I would like to thank you very much for your kind support and understanding. I would like to thank the members of my student research committee \textbf{Dr. Y. K. Prajapati} \emph{(ECED, MNNIT Allahabad)}, and \textbf{Prof. D. K. Yadav} \emph{(CSED, MNNIT Allahabad)}.
\par I am also extremely grateful to \textbf{Prof. Amit Dhawan} \emph{(HOD ECED, MNNIT)}, \textbf{Prof. Rajeev Tripathi} \emph{(Director, MNNIT Allahabad)}, \textbf{Dr. Manish Tiwari} \emph{(Convenor DDPC, ECED, MNNIT Allahabad)}, \textbf{Prof. Vijay Shankar Tripathi} \emph{(ECED, MNNIT Allahabad)}, and \textbf{Dr. Arun Prakash} \emph{(ECED, MNNIT Allahabad)}, for their sincere cooperation and continuous encouragement. I would like to thank the other respected faculty members and staff of ECED MNNIT Allahabad for their support in the fulfillment of the Ph.D. work.
\par Getting through my thesis required more than academic support, and I have many, many people to thank for listening to and, at times, having to tolerate me in the up and down in this journey. I cannot begin to express my gratitude and appreciation for their friendship. I also appreciate all the contributions from my friends and teammates \textbf{\textit{Tarique Rashid}}, \textbf{\textit{Akshay Verma}}, and especially \textbf{\textit{Sunil Kumar}} for motivating me from time to time. For many memorable evenings out and in, I must thank everyone above as well as \textbf{\textit{Satya Prakash}}, \textbf{\textit{Pushpender Gupta}}, and \textbf{\textit{Vikrant Varhney}}.
