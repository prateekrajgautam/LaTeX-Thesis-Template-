  abstract = {In this paper, we present the problem of mixed sound event verification in a wireless sensor network for home automation systems. In home automation systems, the sound recognized by the system becomes the basis for performing certain tasks. However, if a target source is mixed with another sound due to simultaneous occurrence, the system would generate poor recognition results, subsequently leading to inappropriate responses. To handle such problems, this study proposes a framework, which consists of sound separation and sound verification techniques based on a wireless sensor network (WSN), to realize sound-triggered automation. In the sound separation phase, we present a convolutive blind source separation system with source number estimation using time-frequency clustering. An accurate mixing matrix can be estimated by the proposed phase compensation technique and used for reconstructing the separated sound sources. In the verification phase, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and Fisher scores that are derived from the wavelet packet decomposition of signals are used as features for support vector machines. Finally, a sound of interest can be selected for triggering automated services according to the verification result. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of the proposed system for mixed sound verification in WSN-based home environments.},

  abstract = {Energy savings optimization becomes one of the major concerns in the wireless sensor network (WSN) routing protocol design, due to the fact that most sensor nodes are equipped with the limited nonrechargeable battery power. In this paper, we focus on minimizing energy consumption and maximizing network lifetime for data relay in one-dimensional (1-D) queue network. Following the principle of opportunistic routing theory, multihop relay decision to optimize the network energy efficiency is made based on the differences among sensor nodes, in terms of both their distance to sink and the residual energy of each other. Specifically, an Energy Saving via Opportunistic Routing (ENS_OR) algorithm is designed to ensure minimum power cost during data relay and protect the nodes with relatively low residual energy. Extensive simulations and real testbed results show that the proposed solution ENS_OR can significantly improve the network performance on energy saving and wireless connectivity in comparison with other existing WSN routing schemes.},

  abstract = {Fast and effective monitoring following airborne releases of toxic substances is critical to mitigate risks to threatened population areas. Electrically powered systems in industrial settings require monitoring of emitted electromagnetic fields to determine the status of the equipment and ensure their safe operation. In situations such as these, wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) at fixed predetermined locations provide monitoring to ensure safety. A challenging algorithmic problem is determining the locations to place these WSNs while meeting several criteria: (1) to provide complete coverage of the domain; (2) to create a topology with problem-dependent node densities; and (3) to minimize the number of WSNs. This paper presents a novel approach, advancing front mesh generation with constrained Delaunay triangulation and smoothing (AFECETS) that addresses these criteria. A unique aspect of AFECETS is the ability to determine WSN locations for areas of high interest (hospitals, schools, and high population density areas) that require higher density of nodes for monitoring environmental conditions, a feature that is difficult to find in other research work. The AFECETS algorithm was tested on several arbitrary shaped domains. AFECETS simulation results show that the algorithm provides significant reduction in the number of nodes, in some cases over 40%, compared with an advancing front mesh generation algorithm; maintains and improves optimal spacing between nodes; and produces simulation run times suitable for real-time applications.},

  abstract = {Robotic sensor networks provide an effective approach for underground pipeline inspection. Such networks are comprised of sensor nodes (SNs) and relay nodes (RNs) carried by robots for information sensing and communication, and are able to perform accurate and realtime inspection, especially in adverse environments. SN localization is critical in such networks because localization results can be used not only for locating and pinpointing leaks, but also for maneuvering mobile SNs in a pipeline of complex configuration. However, both the underground operational environment and the limited resources of the SNs pose significant challenges for SN localization. This paper presents algorithms for SN localization in robotic sensor networks for underground pipeline inspection. Specifically, self-localization of underground in-pipe SNs were investigated by taking into account SN movement dynamics, and using the measurements of the SN's velocity and the received signal strength (RSS) of the radio signal from aboveground RNs. Depending on the availability of the RSS at the SN, different localization algorithms based on the Kalman filter are proposed for different scenarios. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. The framework also provides insight into the design of robotic sensor networks for the inspection and maintenance of other types of pipeline systems, such as oil and gas pipelines.},

  abstract = {Device-free wireless localization (DFL) is a promising technique. It can localize and track a target without carrying any electronic device. Compared with traditional received signal strength (RSS)-based DFL, the recently proposed time-of-flight (TOF)-based DFL technique could achieve better performance. However, TOF-based DFL requires that each pair of nodes should perform a pairwise TOF measurement sequentially, which makes it impractical for being utilized in time and energy sensitive applications. Inspired by the fact that a target shadows only a small subset of wireless links, which travel through its spatial impact area, we incorporate link state estimation function into particle filter (PF) framework to predict shadowed links and design a parallel scanning scheme to scan multiple shadowed links simultaneously. The aforementioned methods guarantee that the effective TOF measurements can be acquired timely and energy efficiently. Meanwhile, to achieve reasonable localization performance with these reduced-under-sampled link measurements, we utilize compressive sensing (CS) algorithm to reconstruct the shadowing effect map (SEM). With the map as observation likelihood function, PF algorithm could estimate targets location accurately. Experimental results with an 802.15.4a chirp spread spectrum ranging hardware testbed show that the average running time and energy consumption reduce remarkably.},

Unfortunately, most of the suggested solutions for indoor localization consist of theoretical work or have been evaluated in non-industrial environments, typically office spaces. To evaluate the influence of industrial environments on localization accuracy, in this paper, a time-of-arrival (ToA) approach was used to determine the stationary locations of a robot inside the w-iLab.t II testbed, an open industrial-like environment containing several metal obstacles. The ToA method utilizes the measured propagation time of a radio wave between a sender and receiver to estimate their corresponding distance. This paper evaluates several industrial-related deployment aspects that influence location accuracy and describes how their negative impact can be reduced, resulting in an almost 50\% accuracy improvement in industrial environments.},

The proposed scheme effectively increases the probability of correct decision about the state of the machine, reduces the probability of false alarms at a given signal level, and reduces the overall energy consumption as compared to noncooperative schemes.

  abstract = {Based on inverse hydraulic thermodynamic transient analyses and on an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO), a leak detection and localization method is proposed for liquid pipelines. The finite volume method, was employed to numerically model the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. To determine the optimum improved PSO algorithm, and corresponding parameters, four types of algorithms were used for the analyses of a virtual pipeline. Accuracy, stability, robustness, and false alarm rate tests were conducted. The SIPSO algorithm has been shown to outperform the other algorithms. Two oil pipelines were utilized as example cases in conjunction with the use of the SIPSO algorithm. One of these pipelines was involved in a field opening experiment, while the other was involved in a real leak accident. The results demonstrated that smaller relative errors were achieved with the proposed method for the estimations of the location, coefficient, and starting time of the leak.},
