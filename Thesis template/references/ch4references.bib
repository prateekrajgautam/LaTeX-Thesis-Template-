  abstract = {Device-free wireless localization (DFL) is a promising technique. It can localize and track a target without carrying any electronic device. Compared with traditional received signal strength (RSS)-based DFL, the recently proposed time-of-flight (TOF)-based DFL technique could achieve better performance. However, TOF-based DFL requires that each pair of nodes should perform a pairwise TOF measurement sequentially, which makes it impractical for being utilized in time and energy sensitive applications. Inspired by the fact that a target shadows only a small subset of wireless links, which travel through its spatial impact area, we incorporate link state estimation function into particle filter (PF) framework to predict shadowed links and design a parallel scanning scheme to scan multiple shadowed links simultaneously. The aforementioned methods guarantee that the effective TOF measurements can be acquired timely and energy efficiently. Meanwhile, to achieve reasonable localization Performance with these reduced-under-sampled link measurements, we utilize compressive sensing (CS) algorithm to reconstruct the shadowing effect map (SEM). With the map as observation likelihood function, PF algorithm could estimate targets location accurately. Experimental results with an 802.15.4a chirp spread spectrum ranging hardware testbed show that the average running time and energy consumption reduce remarkably.},

Unfortunately, most of the suggested solutions for indoor localization consist of theoretical work or have been evaluated in non-industrial environments, typically office spaces. To evaluate the influence of industrial environments on localization accuracy, in this paper, a time-of-arrival (ToA) approach was used to determine the stationary locations of a robot inside the w-iLab.t II testbed, an open industrial-like environment containing several metal obstacles. The ToA method utilizes the measured propagation time of a radio wave between a sender and receiver to estimate their corresponding distance. This paper evaluates several industrial-related deployment aspects that influence location accuracy and describes how their negative impact can be reduced, resulting in an almost 50\% accuracy improvement in industrial environments.},

Three receivers adopting a smart antenna technique cooperate with each other to locate the patients using the angulation positioning method. In order to be able to track patients in environment with high patient density, a high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm for the coexistence of noncircular and circular signals is proposed. First, the maximal and common noncircularity rated signals are preliminarily estimated. Second, based on the noise space block matrix, the DOAs of these signals are re-estimated with high accuracy. Then, the covariance matrix of the maximal and common noncircularity rated signals is reconstructed. The contributions of these signals are eliminated after performing a subtraction operation on the covariance matrix of the received data and only those of circular signals remain. Finally, the DOAs of circular signals are obtained. Results of simulations and real tests demonstrate the effectiveness and Performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {As a low-cost distance measurement method, received signal strength (RSS) is often used for indoor wireless sensor localisation. However, RSS values can be easily influenced by multi-path fading, noise and other environmental parameters. This decreases the accuracy and stability of estimated distance. To improve localisation accuracy, this study proposes a multiplicative distance-correction factor (MDCF) to counteract the inaccuracy of estimated distance. In the same indoor environment, the product of this CF and estimated distance is regarded as a good approximation of real distance between unknown node and an anchor node. Then, two location estimated methods based on MDCF (MDCF-grid and MDCF-particle swarm optimisation) are proposed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed location estimation methods can significantly improve localisation accuracy without extra hardware in practical indoor scenarios.},

  abstract = {Summary Localizing machine-type communication (MTC) devices or sensors is becoming important because of the increasing popularity of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks for location-based applications. These include such as health monitoring, rescue operations, vehicle tracking, and wildfire monitoring. Moreover, efficient localization approaches for sensor-based MTC devices reduce the localization error and energy consumption of MTC devices. Because sensors are used as an integral part of M2M communication networks and have achieved popularity in underwater applications, research is being conducted on sensor localization in both underwater and terrestrial M2M networks. Major challenges in designing underwater localization techniques are the lack of good radio signal propagation in underwater, sensor mobility management, and ensuring network coverage in 3D underwater M2M networks. Similarly, predicting the mobility pattern of MTC devices, trading-off energy consumption and location accuracy pose great design challenges for terrestrial localization techniques. This article presents a comprehensive survey on the current state-of-the-art research on both terrestrial and underwater localization approaches for sensor-based MTC devices. It also classifies localization approaches based on several factors, identifies their limitations with potential solutions, and compares them. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
