  abstract  = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) were emerged with the recent advances
	in the field of micro-electronics and the emergence of wireless communication
	technology. Although, it has been shown that mobility alleviates
	several issues relating to sensor network like the coverage optimization
	and the connectivity. The need for node localization is one of the
	most important challenges when considering mobility. Localization
	in WSN means estimating the position or spatial coordinates of nodes.
	This paper addresses the various issues in localization and presents
	the state of the art of localization algorithms in Mobile WSNs (MWSNs).
	In this paper, we classified the localization algorithms based on
	the localization technique, the anchor based/cooperative, the nodes'
	mobility state and the information state and, we presented a detailed
	analysis of the representative localization algorithms. Moreover,
	we compared the existing localization algorithms and we discussed
	some possible directions of future research for the localization

	of the wireless sensor network, the localization methods are different

	the sensor node to optimize the tradeoff between localization performance
	and energy consumption, cooperative node localization, and localization

	Location awareness enables various applications from object tracking

	Therefore, WSN localization have become an important area that attracted
	significant research interest. In the most common case, position
	related parameters are first extracted from the received measurements,
	and then used in a second step for estimating the position of the
	tracked node by means of a specific algorithm. From this perspective,
	this chapter is intended to provide an overview of the major localization
	techniques, in order to provide the reader with the necessary inputs
	to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and/or apply these techniques
	to localization problems such as robot networks. We first review
	the most common measurement techniques, and study their theoretical

	classify the main localization algorithms, taking those measurements

	proposes a multiplicative distance-correction factor (MDCF) to counteract

  abstract = {Summary Localizing machine-type communication (MTC) devices or sensors
	is becoming important because of the increasing popularity of machine-to-machine
	(M2M) communication networks for location-based applications. These
	include such as health monitoring, rescue operations, vehicle tracking,
	and wildfire monitoring. Moreover, efficient localization approaches
	for sensor-based MTC devices reduce the localization error and energy
	consumption of MTC devices. Because sensors are used as an integral
	part of M2M communication networks and have achieved popularity in
	underwater applications, research is being conducted on sensor localization
	in both underwater and terrestrial M2M networks. Major challenges
	in designing underwater localization techniques are the lack of good
	radio signal propagation in underwater, sensor mobility management,
	and ensuring network coverage in 3D underwater M2M networks. Similarly,
	predicting the mobility pattern of MTC devices, trading-off energy
	consumption and location accuracy pose great design challenges for
	terrestrial localization techniques. This article presents a comprehensive
	survey on the current state-of-the-art research on both terrestrial
	and underwater localization approaches for sensor-based MTC devices.
	It also classifies localization approaches based on several factors,
	identifies their limitations with potential solutions, and compares

  abstract = {In emerging sensor network applications, localization in wireless
	sensor network is a recent area of research. Requirement of its applications
	and availability of resources need feasible localization algorithm
	with lower cost and higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose an
	Advanced DV-Hop localization algorithm that reduces the localization
	error without requiring additional hardware and computational costs.
	The proposed algorithm uses the hop-size of the anchor (which knows
	its location) node, from which unknown node measures the distance.
	In the third step of Advanced DV-Hop algorithm, inherent error in
	the estimated distance between anchor and unknown node is reduced.
	To improve the localization accuracy, we use weighted least square
	algorithm. Furthermore, location of unknown nodes is refined by using
	extraneous information obtained by solving the equations. By mathematical
	analysis, we prove that Advanced DV-Hop algorithm has lesser correction
	factor in the distance between anchor and the unknown node compared
	with DV-Hop algorithm, improved DV-Hop algorithm (Chen et al. 2008)
	and improved DV-Hop algorithm (Chen et al. in IEICE Trans Fundam
	E91-A(8), 2008), which is cause of better location accuracy. Simulation

	Applications of WSNs like forest fire detection, nuclear or biological
	attacks, locating survivors post-disasters, etc. require location-aware
	information for real time and accurate response. Generally, the sensor
	nodes are not equipped with global positioning system due to its
	inefficiency for indoor and underwater regions. Other drawbacks include
	cost and power consumption. Localization in 3D WSNs is a complex
	task. The complexity increases due to an additional dimension leading
	to larger neighboring nodes and increase in coverage area (i.e.,
	area coverage of a sensor node changes from circular to spherical).
	A lot of approaches have been proposed to localize the sensor nodes
	in 2D and are now being seen in 3D aspect. Although good efforts
	have been made for research summarization and guidance in 2D localization,
	it lacked attention by the researchers in 3D scope. This paper provides
	a comprehensive survey of the algorithms designed for localizing
	the sensor nodes in terrestrial and underwater regions. These algorithms
	have been classified based on the nature of anchor nodes. The localization
	methods have been categorized as static anchor node-based or mobile
	anchor node-based and further range-free or range-based depending
	upon the number of anchor nodes availability and distance estimation
	technique, respectively. The limitations and challenges of the proposed
	approaches have also been discussed briefly. The paper also tabulates
	these methods on the basis of attributes like localization process,
	complexity, number of sensor nodes used, etc.},

	penetration of intelligence into ubiquitous things, including physical
	objects, cyber-entities, social-elements or individuals, and human
	thinking. The development of Smart World is enabled by diverse applications
	of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) into those components identified
	as things. Such a smart-world will have features controlled significantly
	by the location information. Control and Policy information of Smart
	World services, often addressed as location-based services (LBSs),
	are governed by location data. Localization thus becomes the key
	enabling technology for Smart World facilities. It is generally classified
	as active and passive techniques in nature. Active localization is
	a widely adopted localization scheme where the target is detected
	and tracked carries a tag or attached device. The other category,
	Passive methods, defines targets to be localized as free of carrying
	a tag or device, hence also referred to as device-free localization
	(DFL) or sensor-less localization. The passive approach is a well
	suited for the development of diverse smart world applications with
	ubiquitous localization. DFL schemes fall into a wide range of application
	scenarios within the Smart World ecosystem. A few notable examples
	are occupancy detection, identity definition, positioning, gesture
	detection, activity monitoring, pedestrian and vehicle-traffic flow
	surveillance, security safeguarding, ambient intelligence-based systems,
	emergency rescue operations, smart work-spaces and patient or elderly
	monitoring. In this paper, the revolution of DFL technologies have
	been reviewed and classified comprehensively. Further, the emergence
	of the Smart World paradigm is analyzed in the context of DFL principles.
	Moreover, the inherent challenges within the application domains
	have been extensively discussed and improvement strategies for multi-target
	localization and counting approach are discussed. Finally, current
	trends and future research directions have been presented.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses target localization problems in both noncooperative
	and cooperative 3-D wireless sensor networks (WSNs), for both cases
	of known and unknown sensor transmit power, i.e., PT . We employ
	a hybrid system that fuses distance and angle measurements, extracted
	from the received signal strength and angle-of-arrival information,
	respectively. Based on range and angle measurement models, we derive
	a novel nonconvex estimator based on the least squares criterion.
	The derived nonconvex estimator tightly approximates the maximum-likelihood
	estimator for small noise. We then show that the developed estimator
	can be transformed into a generalized trust region subproblem framework,
	by following the squared range approach, for noncooperative WSNs.
	For cooperative WSNs, we show that the estimator can be transformed
	into a convex problem by applying appropriate semidefinite programming
	relaxation techniques. Moreover, we show that the generalization
	of the proposed estimators for known PT is straightforward to the
	case where PT is not known. Our simulation results show that the
	new estimators have excellent performance and are robust to not knowing
	PT . The new estimators for noncooperative localization significantly
	outperform the existing estimators, and our estimators for cooperative
	localization show exceptional performance in all considered settings.},

	network (WSN) localization, there are still many unsolved problems
	in this area. The challenges to be addressed are both in analyzing
	characteristics of the localizable WSNs and designing efficient localization
	algorithms under a variety of conditions. In this paper we first
	draw on powerful results from graph rigidity theory and combinatorial
	theory, revealing that the combination of distance constraint and
	bearing constraint leads to necessary and sufficient condition for
	unique localization. This enlightens our proposing an anchor-free
	and computationally simple ad hoc localization algorithm for WSNs.
	A novel combination of distance and direction estimation technique
	is introduced to detect and estimate ranges between neighbors. Using
	this information we construct unidirectional local coordinate systems
	to avoid the reflection ambiguity. Such local maps then converge
	to form a global network wide coordinate system using a transformation
	matrix [T], which finally leads to node absolute positions. Simulation
	results have shown that our algorithm achieves high accuracy without
	using any error refining schemes.},

In WSNs, QoSPerformance metricsQuality of Serviceis compromised to conserve energy and preserve the life of the network. Concern must be accorded at every level of the protocol stack to conserve energy, and to allow individual nodes to reconfigure the network and modify their set of tasks according to the resources available. The protocol stack for WSNs consists of five standard protocol layers trimmed to satisfy typical sensors features, namely, application layerApplication layer, transport layerTransport layer, network layerNetwork layer, data-link layer, and physical layerPhysical layer. These layers address network dynamics and energy efficiency. Functions such as localization, coverage, storage, synchronization, security, and data aggregationDataaggregationand compression are network services that enable proper sensors functioning. Implementation of WSNs protocols at different layers in the protocol stack aims at minimizing energy consumptionEnergy consumption, and end-to-endEnd-to-endCongestion control: end-to-endCongestion controlend-to-enddelay, and maintaining system efficiency. Traditional networking protocols are not designed to meet these WSNs requirements, hence, new energy-efficient protocols have been proposed for all layers of the protocol stack. These protocols employ cross-layer optimization by supporting interactions across the protocol layers. Specifically, protocol state information at a particular layer is shared across all the layers to meet the specific requirements of the WSN.},
