	issues relating to sensor network coverage and connectivity, many
	challenges remain. Among these, the need for position estimation
	is perhaps the most important. Not only is localization required
	to understand sensor data in a spatial context, but also for navigation,
	a key feature of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present a survey
	on localization methods for mobile wireless sensor networks. We provide

  abstract = {Localization is a process of finding the coordinates of the deployed

	Applications of WSNs like forest fire detection, nuclear or biological
	attacks, locating survivors post-disasters, etc. require location-aware
	information for real time and accurate response. Generally, the sensor
	nodes are not equipped with global positioning system due to its
	inefficiency for indoor and underwater regions. Other drawbacks include
	cost and power consumption. Localization in 3D WSNs is a complex
	task. The complexity increases due to an additional dimension leading
	to larger neighboring nodes and increase in coverage area (i.e.,
	area coverage of a sensor node changes from circular to spherical).
	A lot of approaches have been proposed to localize the sensor nodes
	in 2D and are now being seen in 3D aspect. Although good efforts
	have been made for research summarization and guidance in 2D localization,
	it lacked attention by the researchers in 3D scope. This paper provides
	a comprehensive survey of the algorithms designed for localizing
	the sensor nodes in terrestrial and underwater regions. These algorithms
	have been classified based on the nature of anchor nodes. The localization
	methods have been categorized as static anchor node-based or mobile
	anchor node-based and further range-free or range-based depending
	upon the number of anchor nodes availability and distance estimation
	technique, respectively. The limitations and challenges of the proposed
	approaches have also been discussed briefly. The paper also tabulates

  abstract = {The 'Smart World' envisioned by technology will be achieved by the
	penetration of intelligence into ubiquitous things, including physical
	objects, cyber-entities, social-elements or individuals, and human
	thinking. The development of Smart World is enabled by diverse applications
	of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) into those components identified
	as things. Such a smart-world will have features controlled significantly
	by the location information. Control and Policy information of Smart
	World services, often addressed as location-based services (LBSs),
	are governed by location data. Localization thus becomes the key
	enabling technology for Smart World facilities. It is generally classified
	as active and passive techniques in nature. Active localization is
	a widely adopted localization scheme where the target is detected
	and tracked carries a tag or attached device. The other category,
	Passive methods, defines targets to be localized as free of carrying
	a tag or device, hence also referred to as device-free localization
	(DFL) or sensor-less localization. The passive approach is a well
	suited for the development of diverse smart world applications with
	ubiquitous localization. DFL schemes fall into a wide range of application
	scenarios within the Smart World ecosystem. A few notable examples
	are occupancy detection, identity definition, positioning, gesture
	detection, activity monitoring, pedestrian and vehicle-traffic flow
	surveillance, security safeguarding, ambient intelligence-based systems,
	emergency rescue operations, smart work-spaces and patient or elderly
	monitoring. In this paper, the revolution of DFL technologies have
	been reviewed and classified comprehensively. Further, the emergence
	of the Smart World paradigm is analyzed in the context of DFL principles.
	Moreover, the inherent challenges within the application domains
	have been extensively discussed and improvement strategies for multi-target
	localization and counting approach are discussed. Finally, current
	trends and future research directions have been presented.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel design paradigm, intended as a
	network of billions to trillions of tiny sensors communicating with
	each other to offer innovative solutions to real time problems. These
	sensors form a network named as wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to
	monitor physical environment and disseminate collected data back
	to the base station through multiple hops. WSN has the capability
	to collect and report data for a specific application. The location
	information plays an important role for various wireless sensor network
	applications. A majority of the applications are related to location-based
	services. The development of sensor technology, processing techniques,
	and communication systems give rise to a development of the smart
	sensor for the adaptive and innovative application. So a single localization
	technique is not adequate for all application. In this paper, a recent
	extensive analysis of localization techniques and hierarchical taxonomy
	and their applications in the different context is presented. This
	taxonomy of the localization technique is classified based on presence
	of offline training in localization, namely self-determining and
	training dependent approaches. Finally, various open research issues
	related to localization schemes for IoT are compared and various
	directions for future research are proposed.},

	adopting a smart antenna technique cooperate with each other to locate
	the patients using the angulation positioning method. In order to
	be able to track patients in environment with high patient density,
	a high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm
	for the coexistence of noncircular and circular signals is proposed.
	First, the maximal and common noncircularity rated signals are preliminarily
	estimated. Second, based on the noise space block matrix, the DOAs
	of these signals are re-estimated with high accuracy. Then, the covariance
	matrix of the maximal and common noncircularity rated signals is
	reconstructed. The contributions of these signals are eliminated
	after performing a subtraction operation on the covariance matrix
	of the received data and only those of circular signals remain. Finally,
	the DOAs of circular signals are obtained. Results of simulations
	and real tests demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the
	proposed algorithm.},
