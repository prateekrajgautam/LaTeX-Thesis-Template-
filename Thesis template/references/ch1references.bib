  abstract        = {Over the past decade we have witnessed the evolution of wireless sensor networks, with advancements in hardware design, communication protocols, resource efficiency, and other aspects. Recently, there has been much focus on mobile sensor networks, and we have even seen the development of small-profile sensing devices that are able to control their own movement. Although it has been shown that mobility alleviates several issues relating to sensor network coverage and connectivity, many challenges remain. Among these, the need for position estimation is perhaps the most important. Not only is localization required to understand sensor data in a spatial context, but also for navigation, a key feature of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present a survey on localization methods for mobile wireless sensor networks. We provide taxonomies for mobile wireless sensors and localization, including common architectures, measurement techniques, and localization algorithms. We conclude with a description of real-world mobile sensor applications that require position estimation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Despite a large number of approaches developed for wireless sensor network (WSN) localization, there are still many unsolved problems in this area. The challenges to be addressed are both in analyzing characteristics of the localizable WSNs and designing efficient localization algorithms under a variety of conditions. In this paper we first draw on powerful results from graph rigidity theory and combinatorial theory, revealing that the combination of distance constraint and bearing constraint leads to necessary and sufficient condition for unique localization. This enlightens our proposing an anchor-free and computationally simple ad hoc localization algorithm for WSNs. A novel combination of distance and direction estimation technique is introduced to detect and estimate ranges between neighbors. Using this information we construct unidirectional local coordinate systems to avoid the reflection ambiguity. Such local maps then converge to form a global network wide coordinate system using a transformation matrix [T], which finally leads to node absolute positions. Simulation results have shown that our algorithm achieves high accuracy without using any error refining schemes.},

However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart sensors in WSN, a single localization technique that affects the overall performance is not sufficient for all applications. Thus, there have been many significant advances on localization techniques in WSNs in the past few years. The main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for localization in WSNs. Specifically, we present the recent advances on localization techniques in WSNs by considering a wide variety of factors and categorizing them in terms of data processing (centralized vs. distributed), transmission range (range free vs. range based), mobility (static vs. mobile), operating environments (indoor vs. outdoor), node density (sparse vs. dense), routing, algorithms, etc. The recent localization techniques in WSNs are also summarized in the form of tables. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of localization in sensor networks, as well as research trends and future research directions in this area.},

Location awareness enables various applications from object tracking to event monitoring, and also supports core network services such as: routing, topology control, coverage, boundary detection and clustering. Therefore, WSN localization have become an important area that attracted significant research interest. In the most common case, position related parameters are first extracted from the received measurements, and then used in a second step for estimating the position of the tracked node by means of a specific algorithm. From this perspective, this chapter is intended to provide an overview of the major localization techniques, in order to provide the reader with the necessary inputs to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and/or apply these techniques to localization problems such as robot networks. We first review the most common measurement techniques, and study their theoretical accuracy limits in terms of Cramer-Rao lower bounds. Secondly, we classify the main localization algorithms, taking those measurements as input in order to provide an estimated position of the tracked node(s).},

To show the applicability of proposed algorithm in anisotropic network, radio irregularity model is also considered.

  abstract = {In emerging sensor network applications, localization in wireless sensor network is a recent area of research. Requirement of its applications and availability of resources need feasible localization algorithm with lower cost and higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose an Advanced DV-Hop localization algorithm that reduces the localization error without requiring additional hardware and computational costs. The proposed algorithm uses the hop-size of the anchor (which knows its location) node, from which unknown node measures the distance. In the third step of Advanced DV-Hop algorithm, inherent error in the estimated distance between anchor and unknown node is reduced. To improve the localization accuracy, we use weighted least square algorithm. Furthermore, location of unknown nodes is refined by using extraneous information obtained by solving the equations. By mathematical analysis, we prove that Advanced DV-Hop algorithm has lesser correction factor in the distance between anchor and the unknown node compared with DV-Hop algorithm, improved DV-Hop algorithm (Chen et al. 2008) and improved DV-Hop algorithm (Chen et al. in IEICE Trans Fundam E91-A(8), 2008), which is cause of better location accuracy. Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed algorithm is superior to DV-Hop algorithm and improved DV-Hop algorithms in all considered scenarios.},

  abstract        = {Localization is a process of finding the coordinates of the deployed sensor nodes in the sensing area. Localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is important as it results in location-stamped communication. Applications of WSNs like forest fire detection, nuclear or biological attacks, locating survivors post-disasters, etc. require location-aware information for real time and accurate response. Generally, the sensor nodes are not equipped with global positioning system due to its inefficiency for indoor and underwater regions. Other drawbacks include cost and power consumption. Localization in 3D WSNs is a complex task. The complexity increases due to an additional dimension leading to larger neighboring nodes and increase in coverage area (i.e., area coverage of a sensor node changes from circular to spherical). A lot of approaches have been proposed to localize the sensor nodes in 2D and are now being seen in 3D aspect. Although good efforts have been made for research summarization and guidance in 2D localization, it lacked attention by the researchers in 3D scope. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the algorithms designed for localizing the sensor nodes in terrestrial and underwater regions. These algorithms have been classified based on the nature of anchor nodes. The localization methods have been categorized as static anchor node-based or mobile anchor node-based and further range-free or range-based depending upon the number of anchor nodes availability and distance estimation technique, respectively. The limitations and challenges of the proposed approaches have also been discussed briefly. The paper also tabulates these methods on the basis of attributes like localization process, complexity, number of sensor nodes used, etc.},

This survey provides a comprehensive review of such enabling technologies. In particular, we present cellular localization systems including recent results on 5G localization, and solutions based on wireless local area networks, highlighting those that are capable of computing 3D location in multi-floor indoor environments. We overview range-free localization schemes, which have been traditionally explored in wireless sensor networks and are nowadays gaining attention for several envisioned Internet of Things applications. We also present user mobility estimation techniques, particularly those applicable in cellular networks, that can improve localization and tracking accuracy. Regarding the mapping of physical space inside buildings for aiding tracking and navigation applications, we study recent advances and focus on smartphone-based indoor simultaneous localization and mapping approaches. The survey concludes with service availability and system scalability considerations, as well as security and privacy concerns in location architectures, discusses the technology roadmap, and identifies future research directions.},

  abstract        = {The 'Smart World' envisioned by technology will be achieved by the penetration of intelligence into ubiquitous things, including physical objects, cyber-entities, social-elements or individuals, and human thinking. The development of Smart World is enabled by diverse applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) into those components identified as things. Such a smart-world will have features controlled significantly by the location information. Control and Policy information of Smart World services, often addressed as location-based services (LBSs), are governed by location data. Localization thus becomes the key enabling technology for Smart World facilities. It is generally classified as active and passive techniques in nature. Active localization is a widely adopted localization scheme where the target is detected and tracked carries a tag or attached device. The other category, Passive methods, defines targets to be localized as free of carrying a tag or device, hence also referred to as device-free localization (DFL) or sensor-less localization. The passive approach is a well suited for the development of diverse smart world applications with ubiquitous localization. DFL schemes fall into a wide range of application scenarios within the Smart World ecosystem. A few notable examples are occupancy detection, identity definition, positioning, gesture detection, activity monitoring, pedestrian and vehicle-traffic flow surveillance, security safeguarding, ambient intelligence-based systems, emergency rescue operations, smart work-spaces and patient or elderly monitoring. In this paper, the revolution of DFL technologies have been reviewed and classified comprehensively. Further, the emergence of the Smart World paradigm is analyzed in the context of DFL principles. Moreover, the inherent challenges within the application domains have been extensively discussed and improvement strategies for multi-target localization and counting approach are discussed. Finally, current trends and future research directions have been presented.},

abstract        = {The availability of location information has become a key factor in today's communications systems allowing location based services. In outdoor scenarios, the mobile terminal position is obtained with high accuracy thanks to the global positioning system (GPS) or to the standalone cellular systems. However, the main problem of GPS and cellular systems resides in the indoor environment and in scenarios with deep shadowing effects where the satellite or cellular signals are broken. In this paper, we survey different technologies and methodologies for indoor and outdoor localization with an emphasis on indoor methodologies and concepts. Additionally, we discuss in this review different localization-based applications, where the location information is critical to estimate. Finally, a comprehensive discussion of the challenges in terms of accuracy, cost, complexity, security, scalability, etc. is given. The aim of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of existing efforts as well as auspicious and anticipated dimensions for future work in indoor localization techniques and applications.},
